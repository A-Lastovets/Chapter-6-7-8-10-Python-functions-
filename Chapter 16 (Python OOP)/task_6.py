# Task 6: Dunder Method (__str__)
'''
Problem:
1. Create a class Book with attributes title, author, and year_published.
Override the __str__() method to return a string in the format:
"[Title] by [Author] (Published: [Year])"
2. Create an instance of Book and print it to see the custom string representation.

Example Output:

The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald (Published: 1925)
